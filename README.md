# Legacy Account Modernization
<h1>Active Directory Lab - Legacy Account Modernization</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>

In this Project, we will go about **Securing Our Digital Front Door** to maintain the integrity of the enviorment.

Why is this neccessary? Think of our company's digital systems, our data, our applications, our financial records as an highly secure office building.

Our current identity and access system, which controls the 'keys' to this building, thus for the safety and integrity of this building we have to update the keys and locks. This need is very common amongst large organizations for a variety of reasons:
<ul> <li> Employee Growth - When Sarah from Marketing gets promoted to Finance, her old marketing access isn't automatically removed. 
She accumulates access over time, which is a security risk and a compliance problem, called "Access Creep"</ul>
Promotions Create Hidden Security Risk. Consider when Sarah moves from Marketing to Finance. In our current system, her marketing access remains active. This creates a dangerous accumulation of permissions over time, known as 'Access Creep. While Sarah herself is trustworthy, this outdated access becomes a liability. In the event her credentials are stolen, a malicious actor gains a wider foothold with permissions that look legitimate because they're so old. This makes detection harder and turns a simple promotion into a lingering security gap.
